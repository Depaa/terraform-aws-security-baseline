## How to Deploy

1. Run this step:
```
terraform init
```

or if you have the S3 bucket for the state:
```
terraform init -input=false 
    -backend-config="bucket=[BUCKET_NAME]" 
    -backend-config="key=[KEY_PREFIX].tfstate" 
    -backend-config="region=[REGION]"
```

2. Planning what is going to happen:
```
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

3. If everything looks good, deploy:
```
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

## Resources
* AWS Organization
* (you need to enable SSO manually)
* AWS Budgets for cost notification
* SSO user with MFA enabled (by default)
* SCPs, you can enable them by your own (ðŸ‘€ see [README.md](https://github.com/Depaa/terraform-aws-security-baseline/blob/main/policies/README.md))

## Tagging Strategy
Starting with the right tagging strategy in mind is perfect:

* Environment
* Project
* Application
* CostCenter
* Owner
* Department
* Usage (management, scheduled, event-driven, api, etc)
* Sensitive (yes, no)
* Compliance
* IaCTool
