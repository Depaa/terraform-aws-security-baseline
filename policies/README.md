Everything you put in this folder, it will be automatically addeded as Service Control Policy (SCP) when deploying the Terraform code
Policies file name must be something like: abc-...-xyz.json or abc.json

If you see **.tmp** then you can remove it IF YOU NEED IT. It may disrupt the way you are working right now, that's why they are not enabled by default.

You can have **MAXIMUM 5 SCP** files.
